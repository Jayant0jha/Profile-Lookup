# Profile-Lookup
We have an array of objects representing different people in our contacts lists.  A lookUpProfile() function that takes firstName and a property (prop) as arguments has been pre-written for you.  The function should check if firstName is an actual contact’s firstName and the given property (prop) is a property of that contact.  If both are true, then return the value of that property.  If firstName does not correspond to any contacts then return No such contact.  If prop does not correspond to any valid properties then return No such property.  Change the code below // Only change code below this line and up to // Only change code above this line. Ensure that you are editing the inside of the lookUpProfile() function.  This function includes two parameters, firstName and prop. The function should look through the contacts list for the given firstName parameter.  If there is a match found, the function should then look for the given prop parameter. If both firstName and the associated prop are found, you should return the value of the prop. If firstName is found and no associated prop is found, you should return No such property. If firstName isn’t found anywhere, you should return No such contact.
